# Cloud Top IR

This enhancement uses a look-up table to highlight certain temperatures in the clouds. This is often presented as a product from various meteorology agencies and websites.

This enhancement uses calibrated temperatures.

This enhancement is similar to "Enhanced IR", but doesn't suffer from the same terrain contrast issues during the summer or at hot latitudes.

### Appearance

Clouds appear white above -33°C, then blue, green, yellow, red and finally black at -90°C. 

Land and sea appear in shades of gray, where black means hotter.

### Intended usage

Meteorology.

### Limitations

No specific limitation. 

The choice between either enhancement in winter depends mostly on the necessity to compare SatDump data with other meteorological agencies' data and from personal preference.
